This is a project where I helped my client to develop a health care application to improve and regulate his Type - 1 Diabetes condition. 

The software includes a data tracker where the client can upload a CSV File containing any of his health data and immediatly see the data displayed through a desired type of graph.

It also features an notification system where the client can set a notification with any name on any desired time schedule and have a sound and an email sent to remind him about taking his medication etc.
